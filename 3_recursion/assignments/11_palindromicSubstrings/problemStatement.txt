Palindromic sub-strings
Arnab is given a string, he is told to divide the strings into substrings in which every substring is a palindrome.
He is told to print all the possible divisions of the string.

Print the divisions in the increasing order of length of substrings
We will first compare the length of the first substring in one division and print the shorter one first.
If the first substring's length is equal in both divisions then we will check the second substring and continue in this manner.
i.e
if one division is = a b baab
and other division is = a bb a a b
so the length first palindromic substring of both strings are same ( a ), so we check the second substring one is b and other bb
So we will print
a b baab before a bb a a b

Order:
a b baab
a bb a a b

Example:
String: aaa

Output:
a a a
a aa
aa a
aaa

Input format
