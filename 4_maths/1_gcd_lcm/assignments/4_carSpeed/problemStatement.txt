Cars and Speed
Himanshu is in love with BMW and Audi cars. He is wealthy and has a collection of them with the condition that the speed of any car doesn't exceed an integer value
K
. You are given two integers
N
 and
M
, the speed of BMW cars is multiple of
N
 and the speed of Audi cars is multiple of
M
.
BMW car-1 has speed
1
∗
N
, car-2 has speed
2
∗
N
, car-3 has speed
3
∗
N
 and so on till the speed is
<=
K
. That means the number of cars depends upon the multiples of
N
 that are
<=
K
.
The same goes for Audi cars.

Himanshu wants to know the number of cars that has the same speed. Help him find the count.

Input format
The first line contains an integer
T
 denoting the number of test cases.
For each of the next
T
 lines
3
 ​space-separated integers are provided representing the values of
N
￼,
M
￼, and
K
￼ respectively

Output format
For each test case on a new line, print the count of cars with the same speed.

BMW
=
[

Audi
=
[
4
,
8
,
12
,
16

,
48

Common speeds are
=
12
,
24
,
36
,
48
. So the answer is
4
.
