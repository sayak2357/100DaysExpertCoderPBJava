Decreasing Order Strings
Sorting numbers is something we are very much comfortable with. Let's get comfortable with sorting strings as well. The task is simple, given a string
S
 you have to sort the characters of the string in lexicographically-decreasing order.

Note - Do not use inbuilt sorting function.

Input format
The first line contains an integer
T
, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a string
S
 containing only lowercase characters.

Output format
For each test case on a new line, print the string sorted in lexicographically-decreasing order.

Constraints
