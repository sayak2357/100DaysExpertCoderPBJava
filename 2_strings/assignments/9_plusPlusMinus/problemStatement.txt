￼, minus minus makes plus. We have been performing this operation since the school days.
PrepBuddy is sitting in a park and two students are sitting beside him each having one string. Lets say student1 has string
s
￼ and student2 has string
t
￼. Both strings are made up of just two signs
−
￼ and
+
￼ and they are wondering whether string
t
￼ can be obtained from string
s
￼ by using an operation zero or more times.
The allowed operation is:
They can choose any two adjacent minus signs and replace them with a single plus sign. One such operation reduces the length of the string by one.
PrepBuddy asks you to help the students

Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T
, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines.
First-line contains string
s
.
Second line contains string
t
.

Output Format
For each test case on a new line, print YES or NO depending upon whether it is possible to get
t
 from
s
.

Sample test case explanation
In the first test case
string

t
h
 minus sign can be converted to plus sign and we will get -+++ which is equal to string
t
. Hence YES is the output.
