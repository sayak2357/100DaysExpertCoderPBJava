Duplicate Character
Tina is given a string
S
 which contains the first letter of all the student names in her class. She got a curiosity to check how many people have their names starting from the same alphabet. So given a string
S
, she decided to write a code that finds out the count of characters that occur more than once in the string.

Input format
The first line contains an integer
T
, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a string
S
 containing only lowercase characters.

Output format
For each test case on a new line, print the output in the format character=count. If multiple characters have more than one count, print all of them separated by space, in alphabetical order.
In case no such character is present print
−
1
.

Sample test case explanation
In the first string character p is occuring
2
 times and character e is occuring
2
 times. Printing them in alphabetical order we get,
e
=
2

p
=
