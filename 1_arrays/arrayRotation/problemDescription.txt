Array Rotation
PrepBuddy has recently heard about something called Array Rotation and wants you to write a code for rotating an array. So what happens in array rotation is, you are given an integer array
A
 of size
N
 and an integer
K
, you have to rotate the array in the right direction by
K
 steps(See test cases for better understanding). The task is to print the rotated array.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T
 denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line contains
N
, number of elements in the array and
K
 number of steps.
The Second line contains
N
 space-separated integers.

Output Format
For each test case on a new line, print the rotated array.
