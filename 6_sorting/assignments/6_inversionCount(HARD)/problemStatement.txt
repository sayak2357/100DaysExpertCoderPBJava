Inversion Count on set bites
You are given an array
A
 containing
N
 disitnct Integers. We called inversion if two elements
A
[
i
]
 and
A
[
j
]
 form an inversion if
A
[
i
]
>
A
[
j
]
 and
i
<
j
.

Your task is to derive a sequence from the given array
A
. The output is the number of inversion count in the derived sequence.

The new derived sequence is counting the number of set bits in the binary representation of the number in the given array
A
.

Example:
Input:
N
=
4

array
A
=
[
15
,
2
,
7
,
3
]

Binary representation of the given array number is
1111
,
10
,
111
,
11
. The derived sequence is the number of set bits present in the binary representation of array numbers is
[
4
,
1
,
3
,
2
]
. The total number of inversion coucn is
4

Input Format
First line contains an integer
T
, denoting the number of test cases.
For each test cases:
The first line contains an integer
N
, the size of the array
A
.
The second line contains
N
 space separated integers.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer indicating the number of inversion count in the derived sequence.
