N
. Now Arnab is jealous of the hero of the class who also has an array of size
N

1
.

Arnab wants to make his array similar to the Hero's array if it's not already same, containing numbers from
1
 to

 and the frequency of every element is
1
, so that he can be the new hero.

Example
Input

8 4 2 1 9

Output
9

Explanation
Arnab will change
8
 to
3
 and
9
 to
5

3

4
,
2
,
1
,
5
.
So the total cost in curred will be
(
8
−
3
)
+
(
9
