Transition Point
Tina is a computer scientist and a part of her work requires her to find first occurence of
1
 in the array consisting of
0
 and
1
. One good news is that array is sorted. Tina is sure that a sorted array will give solution to this problem in more efficient way. Can you write code to find first occurence of
1
 in the array consisting of
0
 and
1
.

Input
First line contains an integer
T
, number of test cases. Then follows
T
 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.
First line contains
N
, length of the array(
0
-based indexing). Second lines contains
N
 space separated integers
0
 and
1
.

Output
Print
T
 lines, each containing index of first occurence of
1
 if it exists else print
−
1
.
