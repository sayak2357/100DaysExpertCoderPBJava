Floor of a number
We all have learnt about floor of a number in school. Let us try and frame a problem statement around that. So, you are given a number
x
 and a sorted array
A
 containing
N
 distinct integers. Your task is to find floor of
x
 in the array
A
(
0
-based indexing). Now you might be wondering what will be floor of
x
 in
A
? Let me tell you, the floor of
x
 will largest element in
A
 that is smaller than or equal to
x
.

Input format
First line contains an integer
T
, number of test cases. Then follows
T
 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.
First line contains
N
 and
x
.
Second lines contains
N
 space separated integers.

Output format
Print
T
 lines, each containing index of the floor of
x
 if it exists else print
−
1
.
